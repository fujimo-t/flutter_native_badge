# flutter_native_badge_foundation

An iOS and macOS implementation of the flutter_native_badge plugin. Wraps the native APIs for iOS and macOS to set the badge count on the app icon

## Usuage

This package is [endorsed](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#endorsed-federated-plugin), which means you can simply use flutter_native_badge normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do, so you do not need to add it to your pubspec.yaml.

However, if you import this package to use any of its APIs directly, you should add it to your pubspec.yaml as usual.
